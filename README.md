# Toponym-Resolution-in-Text-with-Neural-Language-Models
This M.Sc. thesis proposes a novel method for toponym resolution, using a Transformer-based pre-trained language model (namely the BERT and RoBERTa models), that builds a representation of the toponym to be disambiguated together with its surrounding context. Other toponyms, or even regular words appearing in the surrounding context, can be characteristic of a certain region, which can provide clues about the location of the mention (e.g., the words Louvre or Seine are usually associated with the toponym Paris, and the words fashion or football are usually associated with the toponym Milan).
